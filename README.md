# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available localhost:3000/

I've included react-router-dom to allow you to see that there is no difference with how the functional and class components look when rendered. The only difference is the code itself.

After downloading the repo, you can unzip and open the folder in Visual Studio Code or a text editor/IDE of your choosing. In the terminal, run `npm i`. This will download all the node_modules required to run locally. 

When this is finished, run `npm start` and you can navigate to https://localhost:3000/ . The app will show both components side by side. Notice that the "state" is independent within each component (the counters each operate on their own counts).

There are two types of components: Functional and Class. The functional is located at https://localhost:3000/functional while the class is located at https://localhost:3000/class . You can even open these in the browser next to each other by simply typing in the above links (while the project is running).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
